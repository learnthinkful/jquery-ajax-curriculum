Hi there, before we begin I would like to present you with a list of items you will need to check off before getting started with this course.

You will need...

*   A good text/code editor, I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), but most any editor will do (e.g., [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are great alternatives to Sublime)
*   The [Express to do app](https://github.com/nax3t/ajax-jquery-tutorial) we will be using during this course
*   [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm) installed on your computer (see links for instructions)
*   [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) installed on your computer (see [here](https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-mongodb/1717) if you're using c9)
*   A command line application and an understanding of the basic commands (e.g., `ls, mkdir, touch, mv, rm`)
    *   I use Mac's default terminal with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), but any flavor of terminal will do. If you're using command line for Windows then I recommend you install something like [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) so you can use linux commands in your command line (this is entirely optional, but recommended)
*   If you are using Windows, but you would rather use an environment similar to mine, then I recommend you sign up for [cloud9](https://wdb-c9-invite.herokuapp.com). It is free for educational use.
    *   If you end up using cloud9 then see the note at the bottom of the readme.md file [here](https://github.com/nax3t/ajax-jquery-tutorial/blob/master/readme.md) for setting up and previewing the boilerplate todo app in your workspace
*   A general understanding of JavaScript (loops, conditionals, objects, arrays, variables, etc.)
    *   A great prerequisite to this course is Colt Steele's ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp) on Udemy, where you will learn JavaScript (client-side and server-side), jQuery, Express JS, and much more.

That's all you need to get started!

Happy coding!
